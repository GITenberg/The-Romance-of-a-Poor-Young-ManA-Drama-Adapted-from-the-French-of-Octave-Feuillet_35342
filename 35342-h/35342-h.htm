<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Madame Vauberger</span> <i>peeps in</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span></p>

<p><i>Madame Vauberger.</i> No; he has not yet returned. [<i>Enters.</i>] Things
cannot go on in this manner much longer&mdash;I shall have to speak out,
and plainly too. And why not? Surely he won't take it ill from
me&mdash;ah, no. I, who loved his poor mother so, could never&mdash;What's
this? A purse! empty! And this key, left carelessly lying about;
that's a bad sign. [<i>Opens Secretaire.</i>] No, not one solitary sous&mdash;his
last coin came yesterday to pay me the rent. In the drawer, perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Desmarets</span> <i>looks in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Desmarets.</i> Hallo! [<i>She starts.</i>] What are you at there?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Me, sir?  I was just&mdash;I was just&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Poking your nose into that drawer&mdash;that what you call
just?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> I was dusting and putting the things in order, sir.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> I'll tell you what, Madame V., you're an extraordinary
woman. Yesterday, when I called, you were dusting&mdash;half-an-hour
ago when I called, you were dusting&mdash;and now, when I call again,
you're dusting. Where the devil you find so much dust to dust, <i>I</i>
can't think.</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Ah, sir, look into this drawer.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> What for?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Is it not the place where, if one had money, one would
naturally keep it?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> I suppose so. What of that?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> See, sir, it is empty.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> What's that to me?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> And his purse, also.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> What's that to you?</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Goes up and puts hat on table.</i></p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I dare not tell him that Manuel is without a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 4]</span>
meal&mdash;starving&mdash;I should never be forgiven. His <i>pride</i> would be
wounded, and nothing could excuse that.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Well, what are you cogitating about? Looking for something
to dust?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> I'm thinking of the Marquis, sir.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Well, what of him?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Is it not dreadful? Brought up as he has been&mdash;surrounded
by every luxury&mdash;and now reduced to want even. Oh! it is
too hard&mdash;too hard!</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Well, it's his own fault, isn't it? There was enough left from
the wreck of his father's property, to give him a sort of a living, and
he must needs go and settle it all upon his little sister Helen.</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> And for what? To give her the education befitting her
rank.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Fudge!</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Doctor Desmarets, your're very unfeeling.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Oh, of course, of course. I give him good advice, he rejects
it. I withdraw my sympathy, and then I'm unfeeling. If he
can't manage better with the little that's left him, egad! he may
think himself lucky that he can get his daily meals.</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Sir, he can't even&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Oh, if I dared&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Can't even what? Send for his coupe, I suppose, or drink
Chateau margaux&mdash;terrible hardships, truly. When there's nothing
else in a man's pocket, he had better put his pride there, and button
it up tight.</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Some day, sir, we shall find that he has taken poison, or
cut his throat.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Ah! and then there'll be nothing to dust.</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Monsieur, I repeat it&mdash;you're unfeeling. But I, who loved
and served his dear mother, whom he so much resembles&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Not a bit&mdash;hasn't a look of her. The father, the father all
over.</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Of course. So you always say, and everybody knows
why. You loved the poor Marchioness, offered her your hand, and
she preferred the Marquis.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Madame!</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> I don't care. I <i>will</i> speak my mind. And because she
refused you, you have no regard for her son.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Madame!</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> But if he has his father's face, he has his mother's heart.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Much you know about it.</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> And who <i>should</i> know if I don't? Havn't I attended him
since he was an infant?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Well, and havn't <i>I</i> attended him since he was an infant?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Wasn't I with him during every sickness?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Wasn't I with him too?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Didn't I nurse him?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Didn't I cure him?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Wouldn't I follow him through the world?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Didn't I bring him <i>into</i> it?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Yes, and if things go on at this rate, he won't have much
to thank you for.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> How do <i>you</i> know? How do <i>you</i> know, you foolish old
woman you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Manuel</span> <i>appears</i>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Heyday! the only two friends I have in the world at high
words? What can have caused this?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> My lord, the Doctor says you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Me! my dear Doctor, you never were quarrelling about so
unimportant a person, surely?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> No matter for that. But I have some business with the Marquis,
if this very positive old lady will allow me the luxury of an interview
with him&mdash;a <i>private</i> interview. Pray, ma'am, <i>may</i> I trespass
on your indulgence?</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Truly, Doctor, your campaign in the Crimea has improved
neither your manners, or your beauty.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">L. H.</span></p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Confound her impudence! The attack on my manners I could
forgive, but my beauty&mdash;that's a tender point.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ah, Doctor, you must pardon her brusque manner. If she's
poor in courtesy, she's rich in a rarer gift&mdash;fidelity.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Oh! hang her! let her go. And now to your affairs. Your
father's death occurred while I was with the army, in the Crimea.
Rumors reached me there, but I have never heard the full particulars.
I would not willingly revive a painful theme, but as an old friend&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, I shall be more satisfied when you know the facts.
When you left France you know what our position was, and what our
style of living.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> All the luxuries that money could procure&mdash;a mansion in Paris,
an ancestral chateau, and a stable that could boast the best blood
in France.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Two months after the death of my dear mother, I went to
Italy, by my father's desire, and for several years I traveled through
Europe, at my pleasure. During this time his letters to me were affectionate,
but brief, and never expressed any desire for my return.
Two months ago, on arriving at Marseilles, I found several letters
from him awaiting me, each of them begging me to return home with
all possible haste.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> I remember, it was some time previous to that, that I heard
his name mentioned in connection with some unfortunate speculations
in the stocks.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I arrived at night. The ground was white with snow. As I
passed up the avenue&mdash;made still darker by the old trees which
overshadowed it&mdash;I could hear the frost shaken from the branches,
seeming, as it fell around me, like a warning of bitter tears to come.
Hardly had I crossed the threshold when my father's arms were
around me. I could feel his heart beating against my own, with a
force almost painful. He led me to a sofa, and placed himself directly
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 6]</span>
in front of me, when, as if longing to reveal something which yet
he dared not name, he fixed his eyes on mine with an expression of
supplication, of agony, of shame, wondrous in a man so haughty and
so proud. It was enough! The wrong he had committed, yet
could not confess, I divined full well&mdash;God knows how fully, how
freely I forgave it! Suddenly, that look, which never quitted me,
became fixed, rigid. The pressure of his hand on mine became a
grip of iron. He arose&mdash;the eyes wandered, the hand relaxed, and
he fell dead at my feet!</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> [<i>After a pause.</i>] Well, well, it is a sad history, for he left
utter ruin for your portion. But come, you must not look back.
"Forward" must be the watchword now. Mr. Faveau, your family
lawyer, tells me that the little that remained to you, after paying your
father's debts, you have appropriated to making a fine lady of your
sister.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> To educate her, doctor.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Well, well, same thing; so that you, yourself, have literally
nothing to speak of&mdash;hardly enough to give you bread.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Hardly.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Under these circumstances you will perhaps be disposed to
the favorable consideration of a proposal I have to make?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Name it, sir, for at present, I confess I have formed no plans
of my own. I was so little prepared to find myself quite a beggar.
Were I alone in the world, I would become a soldier. But my sister,
that would involve prolonged absence from her&mdash;perhaps an early
death. My darling&mdash;I cannot endure the thought of knowing her
compelled to suffer the privations, the labor, and the dangers of poverty.
She is happy at her school, and young enough to remain there
for some years to come. If I could but find some occupation by which,
even were I obliged to impose the severest restraints upon myself, it
would be possible to save enough for her marriage portion, I should
be more than content.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> An employment to suit a man of your rank&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Oh, my dear Doctor&mdash;rank&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Well, well, of your <i>education</i>, then, is not easily found. Now,
mark what I am going to say, and consider it well, before you come
to a hasty conclusion. There is, among my patients, a retired merchant,
one who has been able, by indefatigable industry in trade, to
amass a very handsome fortune. His daughter, an only a child, and of
course, the father's darling, has, by chance, become acquainted with
the state of your affairs. Now, I have reason to know, (being on very
confidential terms with them.) I say I have reason to know that this
girl, ambitious, handsome, rich, and accomplished, would be happy
to share your title.  I have the father's consent, and only await the
word from you to&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Dr. Desmarets, my name is neither for sale, or to let.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Humph! Do you know, my lord, that you bear a remarkable
resemblance to your poor mother?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You must be mistaken, sir. I have always been told that I
was more like my father.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Not a bit! The mother, the mother, sir, in every feature.
But, bless me, it's near eleven o'clock and I have a most particular
appointment. As you decline considering the proposal I have made,
we must think of something else. Au revoir. [<i>Aside.</i>] The mother&mdash;eyes,
nose, mouth. What the devil made that stupid old woman say
he was like his father?</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> He's a kind man, though a little eccentric, and apart from
his professional duty, seems actuated by a sincere desire to serve me,
and yet&mdash;and yet I could not bring myself to ask his charity. Hunger&mdash;starvation&mdash;are
not, then, mere empty words. Oh! if I do sin in
my pride, I am punished, for I suffer much. This is the second day
without food. Why, after all, I could go into any Restaurant and
dine, for I am well enough known. I could say I had forgotten my
purse&mdash;have done so without scruple in happier times, but <i>then</i> I
had the means to pay, and now&mdash;no, no, my sister, not for life, not
even for <i>thee</i>, will I descend to lie and cheat. How weak I am; this
comes too soon upon my long sickness. If I could but sleep and so
forget my agony. And there are human creatures who suffer every
day as I do now. My sister, my little sister, I seem to see thy dear
face looking down upon me, and bidding me be comforted. [<i>Music.</i>]
Thou, at least, shall never suffer. But for those who hear their cries
of hunger repeated from the mouths of starving little ones, well,
well, God comfort them; I will not re&mdash;Oh&mdash;holy&mdash;charity&mdash;for&mdash;those&mdash;who&mdash;my
sister&mdash;my&mdash;</p>

to-day. I have no desire to eat.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>He turns away.</i> <span class="smcap">Madame Vauberger</span>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Ah, my Lord, if you knew how you wound my heart.
Come now, you shall pay me for the dinner&mdash;there&mdash;you shall put
the money into my hand the moment you have it. But indeed, indeed,
if you were to give me a hundred thousand francs, it would
not cause me half the pleasure that I should feel in seeing you eat
my poor little dinner. Oh, surely, surely, you can comprehend that.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I do, Louise, I do&mdash;and as I can't give you the hundred
thousand francs, why, I'll eat your dinner.</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> No; <i>will</i> you?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Louise, your hand. Don't be alarmed, I'm not going to
put money into it.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>She timidly gives her hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Oh! thank you, thank you, my lord, a thousand times.
Now, I'll leave you to your dinner. Ah! how good of you to accept
my poor gift. You have a noble heart.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And a monstrous appetite. My kind, faithful Louise. Well,

<p><i>Man.</i> Well, well.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Eats.</i></p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Good! You remember I told you I had an appointment?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Don't talk&mdash;eat! [<span class="smcap">Manuel</span> <i>eats</i>.] That appointment concerned
you. [<span class="smcap">Manuel</span> <i>nods</i>.] I think I've found employment for you.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Eh?</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Pauses with a bit on his fork.</i></p>

<p><i>Des.</i> In with it. [<span class="smcap">Manuel</span> <i>puts it in his mouth</i>.] Good! You are
aware, of course, that my practice and my residence is in the country.
I merely came to Paris on your account. [<span class="smcap">Manuel</span> <i>lets go his fork
to shake hands with the</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>, <i>who puts the fork into his hand
again</i>.] Well, among the families with whom I am most intimate,
there is one, in particular, of great wealth and importance. The
name is Laroque. The family have had for some years past, a managing
man, a steward, who never was worth much. Indeed, the only
real service he has ever rendered them, he has just performed.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ran away?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> No, died. The moment I heard of this, I wrote to Madame
Laroque, asking his situation for a friend of mine. On leaving you,
I went to the post office, and found a letter awaiting me, with the
full consent of the family to my request. To be sure the position for
a man of your rank&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> My rank, under present circumstances, is a mockery. I
shall, in future, take simply my Christian name of Manuel.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> I have only mentioned you in my letters as Monsieur Manuel,
anticipating that such would be your wish. You will have your own
apartments in a pavilion near the Chateau. Your salary will be so
regulated that you will be enabled to lay by a portion for your sister.
Now, the only question remaining is, will this suit you?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Admirably! My dear, kind friend, how shall I sufficiently
thank you?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Eat your dinner.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But am I fitted for the position?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Pretty well. You've learned one great requisite.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What's that?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Economy. As to the rest, the duties are simple enough. And
now I'll give you some notion of the people you are going to meet.
There are, in the Chateau, without counting visitors, five persons.
First, Monsieur Laroque, celebrated at the beginning of the present
century as a famous privateer Captain. Hence his large fortune. He
is now a feeble old man, mind and memory a good deal the worse for
wear. Then there is Madame Laroque, his daughter-in-law, a
Creole&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> A Creole?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Yes, young gentleman, an <i>elderly</i> Creole, with some eccentricities
to be sure, but a good heart. Thirdly, there is Mademoiselle
Marguerite, her daughter, much younger&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> That's singular.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Eat your dinner. She is proud, somewhat romantic, a little
thoughtless,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And her disposition?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Sweet. Fourthly, Madame Aubrey, a widow, a sort of second
cousin, old maidish, talky&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Disposition?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Sour. Fifthly, Mademoiselle Helouin&mdash;Governess. Young,
good looking.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Disposition?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Doubtful. And that completes the catalogue.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Delightful! Two good dispositions out of five. The proportion
is enormous!</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> I'm glad you look at things so hopefully. When will you be
ready to accompany me to the Chateau?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> To-morrow&mdash;to-day.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> To-morrow will do. I shall be here for you early.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I shall be ready.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> [<i>Runs against</i> <span class="smcap">Madame V.</span> <i>who is coming in</i>.] Confound it,
woman, take care!</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> Why, Doctor, you ran against me.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> I didn't!</p>

<p><i>Mad. V.</i> You did!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What's the matter now?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Eat your dinner!</p>

The ladies are determined on a waltz on the terrace.</p>

<p><i>Madame Laroque.</i> What! in the broiling sun?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> The roses do not fear the sun. Why should the lilies?</p>

<p><i>Ladies</i> [<i>all courtesey.</i>] Oh, how pretty.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Yes, rather neat, I think. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Marguerite</span>] Mademoiselle,
may I hope for the honor?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Thank you. Despite your pretty speech, I confess to a
fear of waltzing in the sun. But I'll play for you with pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Well, I must show it to you, if I can drag myself so far.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Drag? Why, good gracious! You're the picture of health
this morning&mdash;fresh as a rose.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Fresh? Frozen. It's a curious fact, Doctor, that since
I left the Antilles, twenty years ago, I have never yet known what it
was to feel comfortably warm.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> That accounts for your continued good looks. Consult your
Cookery Book, page 18. If you want to preserve things fresh, you
must keep them cold. And you, Madame, [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Madame Aubrey</span>]
how do <i>you</i> find yourself?</p>

<p><i>Madame Aubrey.</i> Very weak, Doctor. I ate a tolerable breakfast
this morning.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] You may say that. Three eggs and a broiled chicken.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> And I feel a fullness&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Ah!</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> The fact is, Doctor, I am subject to such continual chagrin,
such cruel mortifications here. Dependent upon others for certain
luxuries which I can't get for myself.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Why not?</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> I should like to <i>try</i>, darling.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> I feel that I was born for the devotion and self-sacrifice

absolutely&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Turns and perceives</i> <span class="smcap">Manuel</span>, <i>who, during the preceding dialogue,
has entered into conversation with the ladies, and has, by this time,
offered his arm to two of them&mdash;They all accompany him off</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Bev.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Well, if I were given to strong sentiments, I should
wish that fellow at the deuce. As it is, I'll content myself with
simply damning his impudence.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Do you know, my dear, that I don't feel quite easy in my
mind about that young man.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Nor I, either.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Why not, mamma?</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> He is much too charming to make a good steward.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Really; I do not perceive it. A person may be honest and
well-behaved, although he does happen to play on the piano.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I don't know that; I flatter myself I have seen something of
the world, and experience has specially taught me to beware of the
man who plays the piano.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Mamma, dear, will you hand me those scissors?</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Yes, my child. [<i>Perceives</i> <span class="smcap">Manuel's</span> <i>portfolio</i>.] Whose
drawing-book is this?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> That? oh! that is the steward's&mdash;I saw it in his hand when
he came in.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> I positively must take a peep. Oh! De Bevannes, look!
beautiful! What a charming accomplishment it is to draw well.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Yes, for an engineer, or a builder&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Or an actor&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Why gracious! Monsieur de Bevannes, you have said a good
thing.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Have I? Allow me to apologize.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Not at all; it's your <i>first</i> offence.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> How beautifully finished these groups are.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Positively, they're not so bad.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Bad! my dear sir; they're exquisite. Look, for instance
at that horse&mdash;is it not perfection?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> It would be, doubtless&mdash;only it happens to be a cow.</p>

<p><i>Mad.L.</i> A cow?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I think so; horses don't go about with two horns.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manuel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Your pardon, ladies; but I believe I left my drawing-book&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Allow me to return it, sir&mdash;and to thank you for an accident
which has afforded us much pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Madame, you are too kind&mdash;so kind, indeed, that you have
too long refrained from permitting me to commence my duties. With
your consent, I will at once set about them. Your farm at Langeot,
of which you spoke to me, is not more, I think, than a mile or two
from this. I will walk over there this afternoon, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Walk! over such a miserable bad road as it is. Indeed,
sir, I could not allow it.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Madame Aubrey</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> Hush! Pray, <i>pray</i>, not so much noise. My dear cousin
has composed himself to sleep.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Noise! it appears to me we were pretty quiet.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> Ah, sir, you might think so; but the least sound jars upon
his poor nerves.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I never saw such a devil of a woman as this is, to
cry.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But I assure you, Madame, that I would rather walk. If I
pretend to be your steward&mdash;why steward I must be, and not fine
gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Marguerite</span>.] My dear, would it be proper to allow
M. Manuel to walk?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I believe it is usual for the steward to do so. However, I see
no reason why he should not ride, if he chooses. There are plenty of
horses in the stable.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> Ah!</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Bev.</i>  What's the matter, Madame?</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> Talking of riding always overcomes me.</p>

me to pass your life in being perpetually overcome.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> A pet horse, dear?</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> No, love, a donkey. Oh!</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Now she's watering the donkey.</p>

those diseases peculiar to that class of quadruped.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> No, no, but no matter; He died&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Peace to his ashes. But as you were saying, Madame Laroque,
there are plenty of horses in the stable, and, really, all but
ruined for want of exercise.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Desmarets</span>.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Yes, that's what you'll <i>all</i> be, if you continue to lounge away
the days as you do.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i>  Ah, Doctor, we've missed you dreadfully.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> What's the matter? anybody sick?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> You ought to have been here just now, Doctor; Madame Aubrey
has told the most touching tale&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Of a donkey? I know, I've heard it often.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> But with regard to a horse for M. Manuel. There's Black
Harry&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Black Harry! Nobody can ride the brute! He's perfectly
untameable! Why, de Bevannes, you tried it yourself and couldn't.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Ahem! Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes, but I had no spurs.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Spurs! Why, you couldn't even get upon his back!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Bevannes</span>] And is Black Harry so very unmanageable?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> 'Pon my word I don't see it. He has an insuperable objection
to being mounted, but if you can get upon his back, and <i>being</i> on his
back, can <i>keep</i> there, why, of course, it's a great point in your favor.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Certainly an important one.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> If you except a partiality for biting, and ditto for kicking,
occasionally shying, and always prone to running away, he's a pleasant
beast.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> But such a beauty! I never saw a horse I should like so
much to ride, if he were but properly broken.</p>

I'll just make his acquaintance now, and if I can succeed in gaining
a small portion of his esteem, I will do myself the honor of riding
him daily until he is fit for your daughter's use.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Bevannes</span>.] What the devil made you mention that confounded

<p><i>Bev.</i> Inconveniently.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> And you want his neck broken?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> No. But I should like his nose put out of joint.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Park of the Chateau Laroque.</i> <span class="smcap">Alain</span> <i>discovered arranging
Portfolio and Drawing materials</i>.</p></div>


<p><i>Alain.</i> Now really I do thank Madame for deputing me to wait
more especially on Monsieur Manuel. Steward or no steward, he's a
perfect gentleman; of that there can't be a doubt. What a pity it
is that Mademoiselle Marguerite and he don't like one another. When
he says white, she says black. When she goes one way, he goes
another, yet everybody else likes him. M'lle Helonin, our Governess,
is absolutely in love with him, and the wonderful influence he
has obtained over old Mons. Laroque, in this short time, is unaccountable.
He has hardly been here three months, and they say that all
the money will be left according to his advice&mdash;but that's going
rather far, even for gossip. Well, now, his drawing materials are all
ready for him, and&mdash;here he is to employ them.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manuel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Alain, did you, by chance, pick up a half finished letter anywhere
in my room?</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> No, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Strange! I commenced it yesterday, and left it on my table,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span>
intending to finish it this morning. I have searched the room
thoroughly, and it is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> Was it of much importance?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Merely inasmuch as it related to family and business matters.
It was for the Doctor, in case he should call when I was from
home. However, let it go. I'll write another when I return. [<i>Sits
down and prepares drawing materials.</i>] Did not Mademoiselle Marguerite
go out on horseback yesterday alone?</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How was it you did not follow her, as usual?</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> Oh, sir, she often goes without me. She's a capital rider,
and she says, to be alone sometimes, makes her feel more self-dependent,
and you know, sir, it won't do to contradict her, for though
a charitable, kind-hearted, young lady, she's rather wilful, and terribly
proud.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Somewhat, perhaps, but her general manner appears to me
more the result of a sad and gloomy thoughtfulness, than mere
pride.</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> Ah, well, I suppose, sir, that, like most young ladies of her
age, she's a little bit in love.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> In love?</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> Yes, sir, Monsieur de Bevannes has been paying her great
attention for some time past, and it would be a grand match, for, after
Monsieur Laroque, he is the richest gentleman in the neighborhood,
and of excellent family. Ah, sir, what a pity it is <i>you</i> are not rich.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why so, Alain?</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> Because&mdash;no matter. Have you any orders for me, sir?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Merely to have a good look for that letter when you go to my
room.</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> I certainly will, sir.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Married&mdash;married&mdash;and to <i>him</i>. Well, and why not? Fool
that I am! Despite of all that should preserve and fence my heart as
with a wall of steel, from every impulse which could induce forgetfulness
of my bitter lot, and the one sacred object of my life, still will
that coward heart indulge in dreams&mdash;wild dreams of one day laying
its most precious offerings at the feet which would but spurn them.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">M'lle Helouin</span>, <i>with basket</i>.</p>

<p>But I will conquer yet, and if the struggle be hard, the victory will
be the more worthy.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] He is alone. Hitherto, I have kept his secret
well; whether I will continue silent, depends upon himself. Courage,
and the poor hireling may yet be a Marchioness. [<i>Comes down to
him.</i>] Oh! Monsieur Manuel, how beautiful that is! You see, while
you have been painting the woods, I have been gathering flowers.
You know we have a ball to-night.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Indeed? I was not aware of it.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> You positively don't seem to know or care about anything
that goes on. You are worse than indifferent, you are unsociable<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Pardon me, not unsociable. But I know my station, and
think it better not to risk being reminded of it.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> [<i>After a pause.</i>] Monsieur Manuel&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Mademoiselle&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Have I ever offended you?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> I have been vain enough to think, at times, that you had
some friendly feeling for me.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And so I have. It is but natural. Our fortunes and positions
are the same, or nearly so. Both dependent on the caprices of
those who employ us, both alone, friendless. This should create
sympathy at least, if not friendship.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> You would not fear, then, to tell me of my faults?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Not if you desired it.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Indeed I do desire it.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> But I only know of one.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Pray name it. Nay, I shall receive it as a kindness.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Well, then I think you admit and encourage somewhat too
great a familiarity with the family in whose employment we are.
Your motives may be, indeed, I'm sure they <i>are</i>, perfectly innocent;
still they will not be so considered, for in this world, the unfortunate
are always suspected.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> True, true. Spoken with a delicacy and candor all you own&mdash;I thank you sincerely&mdash;and you will always continue as now&mdash;my
true friend?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I shall feel honored in the title.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> A true&mdash;a <i>dear</i> friend?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] What is she driving at?</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> A friend that loves me?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Hallo! we're getting tender!</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> A friend that loves me, ardently&mdash;do you hear?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Distinctly.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> And do you comprehend?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Half aside.</i>] I'm afraid I do.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Pretty close quarters. What the deuce is that governess
after? And now for a little scientific pumping. [<i>Comes down.</i>]
Ah, Monsieur Manuel, at your drawing, eh? Beautiful, beautiful,
indeed.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You flatter.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Not at all&mdash;but to change the subject&mdash;by the by, do, I interrupt
your work?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Not in the least.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Well, I was going to compliment you on the vast affection and
confidence you have inspired in poor old Laroque.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I believe he really has a kindly regard for me.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Regard! my dear sir&mdash;you are absolutely wound around his
heart. His affection for his grand-daughter is very great, but no one
has the influence over him that you have. Now, in the strictest confidence,
I'm going to be very frank with you&mdash;and mark me well, you
will not find it to your disadvantage hereafter, if you are equally frank
with <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Really, I don't quite&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> No; but you will presently. Without flattery, I think you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Referring to his picture.</i>] Too green.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Eh? Oh, exactly. I was about to say I think you, in every
way, a gentleman, therefore I don't hesitate to confide in you the fact
that yesterday, after dinner, I was just&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>To picture.</i>] A little blue.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Eh? Oh precisely. I was just on the point of proposing to
Madame Laroque for her daughter's hand, when it suddenly struck
me that I should possess a double claim, if I could, in the first place,
influence you enough in the young lady's favor to make it certain
that the bulk of Monsieur Laroque's property would be left to her.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Monsieur de Bevannes, you really very much over-rate&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Pray forgive me, but you hardly know yourself, the importance
of your good offices in this matter. I was going on to say that
my marriage with Marguerite is all but a settled affair, and, of course,
it is my duty to promote her interests in every possible way. I think
you must concede that?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Surely, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i>Permit me. Now I wish to call to your mind that Madame
Laroque, though a worthy excellent woman, is one of very simple
tastes and habits, and, should too large a portion of the property be
left to her, it would tax and embarrass her to an extent that would<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]</span>
be painful to my feelings. I hope you appreciate my disinterestedness
in the matter.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Oh, thoroughly! But I am still at a loss to imagine where
my interference would be either necessary or effectual.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> My dear friend&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Now <i>he's</i> getting tender!</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> One word from you as to the proper disposition of the money

<p><i>Man.</i> Monsieur de Bevannes, let me end this at once, by telling

<p><i>Bev.</i> And this is the return you make for mine?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I did not solicit it, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Sir, permit me to take your hand.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> The painting of that sheep's head&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes, Madame&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> Reminds me of my own portrait, taken in happier years,

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> That will depend greatly upon you, Monsieur Manuel.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> Yes. Do you know, Monsieur Manuel, that I find my
poor cousin Laroque very much changed,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Indeed he is.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> And for the worse. In fact, he appears to me to be sinking

<p><i>Man.</i> I'm afraid such is the case.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> How fond he is of you&mdash;you, it is well known, possess

<p><i>Man.</i> I have been fortunate enough to make my poor services acceptable

do you happen to be aware how the property will be left?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I do not, Madame.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> I am in a state of painful apprehension, lest the dear old
gentleman should over-estimate the desires and requirements of Madame
Laroque, and should, therefore, curtail any little legacy coming
to <i>me</i>, to make <i>her</i> portion larger, which would be absolutely throwing
money away. I hope you understand my entire want of selfishness
in this matter?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I think I do.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> I was sure you would. Now, if you will use your power
and settle this affair to my advantage, all I can say is, so noble an
action would not go unrewarded.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Not quite; but in order that you may&mdash;I must tell you, Madame&mdash;that

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> M. Manuel, I thought you might like to know that the

<p><i>Man.</i> Thank you&mdash;I'll go to him at once.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> So eager to avoid me. Have a care, my lord Marquis&mdash;spite
of my insignificance, you may learn to rue the day you made
me conscious of it.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bevannes</span>.</p>

<p>And here is one on whom, if I don't very much mistake, I may rely
for aid.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Upon my honor, Mademoiselle, you make quite a pretty
picture&mdash;a wood nymph's reverie; sweet subject, now, for the pencil
of our friend, the steward.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Our friend, the steward, as you term him, has loftier subjects
for his pictures, either aerial or substantial.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Really!</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> And in the former quality his aspirations are sublime.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Mademoiselle, you are an entertaining person, but I never
guessed a conundrum in my life.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> In plain terms, then, this romantic gentleman aspires to
create an interest in the heart of Marguerite.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> O come! I can stand a great deal, but that's rather <i>too</i> good.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> But if I can prove it?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> The thing is too absurd.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> I have just parted from Madame Aubrey.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I congratulate you.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> You jest, M. de Bevannes, but you may one day wake to
find the steward rather a dangerous person. Madame Aubrey has
picked up a letter of his, which was blown out of the window of his
room, into the park. Would you like to see it?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Mademoiselle, I don't pretend to more virtue than my neighbors,
but if I can only get at facts by reading another man's letters,
I'm afraid I shall remain in ignorance.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Marguerite is coming. Would you like to hear the communication
I have to make?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> The contents of the letter?</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> No, but still a somewhat startling discovery.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> On the whole, I think I'll take my departure; for when there's
mischief to be concocted, and two women to brew it, it would be
the grossest vanity in any man to think he could improve the
cookery.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Now if I can instill but one small drop of the poison called
suspicion, her proud, impetuous spirit, will complete the work itself.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Marguerite</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Really, a very touching scene. The affection existing between
the good doctor and our steward is remarkable. If he had
been M. Manuel's father, he could hardly have been more cordially
received.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> And I assure you that M. Manuel's father could not serve
him at this moment as the doctor can.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> My dear governess, you seem to know more of this young
man than you choose to reveal. I remember well your mysterious
words to me the day he first rode and conquered that horse.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Perhaps I have been to blame for having remained silent
so long. But right or wrong, I have, until now, looked upon it as a
duty to keep this person's secret inviolate.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> His secret!</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Nor would I reveal it now, but that his base intentions
are no longer doubtful, and silence would be criminal. However, I
must exact your promise that the knowledge of it shall remain, for
the present, between ourselves.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> You have my word. Proceed.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Four years ago, when you were in Paris&mdash;you are aware
that I was in the habit of visiting some of my old friends at my former
school?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I remember.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Well, I often saw there this very M. Manuel. He visited
the school to see his little sister. His father was the well known
Marquis de Champcey.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Ah!</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> It was the talk of the school that the family were even
then much reduced. Now, they are totally ruined. The father is
dead, and the son has, through the good offices of a friend, been
placed in a position to regain the fortune he has lost. By what means
I leave to your penetration to discover.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> And is it so! [<i>A pause.</i>] But, after all, the conduct of this
young man in no way justifies suspicion. I see him but seldom. In
truth, he actually avoids me.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Of course he does. Reserve creates inquiry, inquiry, interest.
Oh, he has been well tutored.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Enough. I thank you sincerely for the warning. But relieve
your mind of all anxiety; I shall know how to deal with this conscientious
gentleman, be assured.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Indeed I feel the happier that I have at last confided this
fact to you. Ah, my child, to what snares, what treachery, what deceit,
does the possession of wealth expose the innocent. The thought
of them makes the poor governess almost contented with her humble
lot. Come, shall we walk towards the house? As we go, I shall be
able to bring to your recollection many circumstances, trifling in
themselves, but which, when considered in connection with what I
have now told you, will serve to bring full conviction to your mind.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Under which conviction, Mademoiselle, I was on the point of
bringing it to you.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Oh! for some way to make him feel how I despise
him. Do you know, M. Manuel, seeing so little of you, lately,
I was under the impression that death had deprived us of another
steward&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Highly flattered that you should condescend to be under any
impressions concerning so insignificant a person.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I thought that so gifted a gentleman could hardly do anything
without a motive, and now I am informed that your absence
is attributable to the fact that you spend all your evenings with our
noble relative, Mademoiselle Delonnais.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I certainly do, and I deny myself that pleasure the less because
the lady happens to be old enough to be my grandmother. Her
ancestors reigned here formerly, and she&mdash;the last of a noble race&mdash;poor
and infirm, bears so well the dignity of her name, her age, and
her misfortunes, that I feel almost a filial affection for her. Besides,
it was your mother who first introduced me to her.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Oh! no one means to reproach you; on the contrary, I dare
say Madame Laroque is obliged to you for your attention to the good
old lady.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You may remember, too, it was your wish&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Oh, if you want praise or admiration from me, you must be
content to wait. Though young, I have some experience of life. I
know that there are two motives to most human actions. I know that
M'lle Delonnais has a small independence. I know she has no heir,
therefore a little extra attention and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Mademoiselle, permit me to express for you my sincere pity.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Sir!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Permit me to express for you my sincere pity.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Your pity?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes, madame&mdash;if unjust suspicion be the bitter fruit of experience
in one so young. Nothing can merit more compassion than
a heart withered by misbelief, almost before it has begun to exist.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Are you aware of what you say, sir? Are you aware to whom
you speak?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Entirely conscious, Mademoiselle, of both.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] Perhaps you expect me to ask your pardon?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Assuredly I do. Wealth can afford to humble itself&mdash;poverty
cannot.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> His motive, Mademoiselle, is worthy of himself, and proceeds
from a sense of honest pride, which many would do well to imitate.
He is a gentleman, and a man of honor, reduced to sudden poverty,
and compelled to labor for a livelihood. Now, I'm not acute enough

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Giving money.</i>] There.</p>

<p><i>Yvon.</i> Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Are you never afraid here all alone?</p>

<p><i>Yvon.</i> Afraid! No, indeed. That is, not in the day-time, but at
night&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ah, ah, then you have fairies, or spirits, or ghosts here, eh!</p>

<p><i>Yvon.</i> [<i>Disdainfully.</i>] Sir, do you take me for a superstitious fool!
It's all very well for people who don't know any better, but I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Then you do not believe in anything of the kind?</p>

<p><i>Yvon.</i> I should think not, indeed. But if you come to talk about
the white lady, that's quite another matter.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Oh! so there's a white lady, is there?</p>

<p><i>Yvon.</i> Yes, sir, there is indeed, and she walks about on the top of
that tower over there, and where there are no stairs either. But she
is never seen in the day, only in the night, when it is quite dark.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Laughing.</i>] Yes, she is seen when it is too dark to see.</p>

<p><i>Yvon.</i> [<i>Looking out.</i>] Ah! Confound those sheep, at their old tricks
again. [<i>Shouts.</i>] Hi! Hi! I don't believe there's such a troublesome
set of brutes in the whole country, always climbing where they
have no business. Hi! Hi!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why don't you jump down there?</p>

<p><i>Yvon.</i> Try it yourself, if you want to break your neck, my fine

<p><i>Man.</i> Don't be uneasy, I shall go presently.</p>

<p><i>Yvon.</i> The sooner the better. I ain't a coward, but I feel more
comfortable away from here.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> This is a fine old ruin. How is it that I have never found it
out before? I must bring my sketch-book here some day. Alas! I

farewell that I must bid the scenes I had begun to love so well.

<p><i>Mar.</i> This is most fortunate, when the moon rises the view will

<p class="ralign">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> [<i>Crossing.</i>] Stay, sir. As we happen to be alone, will you
answer me fully and frankly, one question. They tell me my manner
towards you is abrupt, unkind, even at times, offensive.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I have never complained.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> But you would leave us?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Mademoiselle.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> And they say that I am the cause. Your departure, sir,
would occasion my mother sincere sorrow, which I am anxious to
spare her, if it be in my power; but I am at a loss to know what
explanation to make you&mdash;what am I to say? that the language
which has offended you, is not always sincere&mdash;that perhaps,
after all, I myself can appreciate joys and pleasures more exalted
than those which the mere possession of wealth can give. Well, it is
possible&mdash;but am I so much to blame, that I use my powers to stifle
thoughts which are forbidden me.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Forbidden?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Yes, forbidden. It may, perhaps, appear like affectation, to
complain of a destiny which so many envy&mdash;but, like my mother, I
believe that were I less rich, I should be the more happy. You have
reproached me with my continual distrust. But in whom <i>can</i> I trust?
I, who from my infancy have been surrounded&mdash;do I not know it too
well&mdash;but by false friends, grasping relatives, and suspicious suitors!
Do you suppose that I am weak and foolish enough to attribute to my
own attractions, the care, the solicitude, with which so many of these
parasites surround me; and even if a pure and noble heart, (should such
a thing exist in this world,) were capable of seeking and loving me for
what I <i>am</i>&mdash;not for what I <i>have</i>&mdash;I should never know it&mdash;[<i>with
meaning</i>]&mdash;for I should never dare the risk! And this is why I
shun, repulse, almost hate, all that is beautiful and good&mdash;all that
speaks to me of that heaven, which is, alas! forbidden me. [<i>The reapers

intend, sir, to burthen you with so much of my confidence; but now
you know me better. You see I have a heart, and if ever I have
wounded yours, I hope you will forgive me. [<i>Gives her hand, which

Now let us go, [<i>returning</i>,] and never let this subject be revived between
us.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Never!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> But before I go, I must see the view from yonder height.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I beg you will not venture&mdash;do not run such a risk.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Ah, I comprehend your purpose. I understand it all. To-morrow
this <i>accident</i> will be noised abroad; the ever-ready tongue
of scandal will be busy with my name, a name which, if less ancient
than your own, is full as stainless, and you trust to my despair to
make me yours! But this vile trick, which crowns all your base
maneuvering, I will thwart. I tell you, sir, that I would incur the
world's contempt, the cloister, anything&mdash;even death itself&mdash;rather
than the disgrace, the ignominy, the shame, of uniting my life to
yours!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Calmly.</i>] I entreat you to be calm. Call reason to your aid.
I understand and respect your distress, but let not your anxiety
prompt you to do me wrong. Consider! How could I have prepared
such a snare, and even were it in my power, how have I ever given
you the right to think me capable of such baseness?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> [<i>Passing</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>] All that I know of you gives me that right.

brought us sorrow, misery, which we dreamed not of. To attain<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 36]</span>
your object, to repair the breach in your fortune, you have usurped
our confidence, sported with our purest and most holy sentiments.
Have I not seen all this? And when you now pledge to me your
honor&mdash;that honor which was too poor and weak to save you from
these unworthy actions&mdash;have I not reason to doubt? Have I not
the right to scorn and disbelieve?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Marguerite, listen to me! I love you, it is true, and never
did love more ardent, more disinterested, more holy, live in the heart
of man. But here, with the eyes of Heaven upon us, I swear that, if
I outlive this night, all beloved as you are, were you upon your knees
at my feet, never would I accept a fortune at your hand. Never! My
heart is yours, yours to break, to crush, to trample in the dust, if it
so please you, but my honor, Madame, is my own and that I will
preserve. And now pray&mdash;pray for a miracle. It is time.</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> There now. I think everything is pretty well arranged
here, so run away all of you and see to the preparations outside.
[<i>Exeunt servants.</i>] 'Pon my life I'm nearly done up. All of a sudden
to change a house that has, for the last five months appeared
like a mourning coach, into a dandified, bright-looking mansion prepared
for a marriage fete, requires more inventive genius than ever I
shall get credit for. If I could only extend my transforming powers
to the faces of the family, I should be much gratified, for such a
grim-looking household exists not in Brittany at this moment.
There's M'lle Marguerite. The nearer the time approaches for the
marriage, the paler she grows. Madame Laroque does nothing but
freeze and shiver, Mons. Manuel is absent for days together, and Madame
Aubrey weeps a good tea-cup full about every two hours. Cheerful
work, very.</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> Monsieur Manuel, M'lle? Why, bless you, he's been at
Largeot for the last three days.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> He has returned. I saw him ride into the court-yard
some fifteen minutes since.</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> Where shall I tell him to come to you, Mademoiselle?</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Are all your preparations made here?</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> Yes, Mademoiselle. I have sent the servants to other work.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Request, Mons. Manuel, then, to see me here, and to come
instantly, as it is important I should speak to him at once.</p>

<p><i>Alain.</i> Very well, Mademoiselle.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Mlle Helouin goes to Arches and ascertains that no one is near to
listen.</i></p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> And now, Manuel Marquis de Champcey, we will try
the issue. How often and how vainly do I question my own heart.
Were Manuel other than he is, should I pursue him thus? What motive
sways my action? Is it love? Ambition? Both? I know not,
and will not reflect. There lies the path. Some resistless impulse
urges me along, nor will I, <i>can</i> I swerve, till all is won or lost.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manuel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Mademoiselle, good evening. Alain informs me that you
wish to speak with me.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> For a few moments. Your stay at Langeot has been
shorter than usual.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I returned a day earlier than I had intended. Respect for
the family suggests that I should not be absent on an occasion like
the present.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> An occasion that gives you an opportunity of showing
that you possess <i>moral</i>, as well as physical courage, of no common
order.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You are pleased to be enigmatical.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> I shall indulge in no enigma that you cannot speedily
solve. And now. Manuel, take good heed of what I say, but I warn
you do not judge me by a common standard. My nature and my
sad dependant lot, place me beyond the pale of those born for a happier
fate. From the first hour we met, my heart was drawn insensibly
towards you. Still that heart was safe. A mere spark existed,
which reason and reflection might have killed; you yourself, in defining
the bond of sympathy between us, raised from that spark a flame.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Madame, in justice to myself, I must interrupt you. Never
by word or deed have I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Go on sir, pray do not spare me. Never have you <i>encouraged</i>,
you would say. Well, I grant it. Be it so. Your reserve and
coldness could not alter me. What fire but burns the fiercer in the
frosty air? And yet if you have pride, so too have I, and I will confess
that something more exists to keep the flame alive than love.
Ambition, and the hope to triumph over one who is a rival. These, I
am free to own, would be incentives enough for me, if love existed not.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Mademoiselle, at the risk of appearing vain, I must tell you
you are most fortunate.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Indeed sir, how so?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> In saying all this to a <i>gentleman</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Oh, sir, of that I'm well aware, by birth&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And <i>principle</i>. I do not affect to despise the one, but I take
more pride in the other. The first, is for the present, buried. Therefore,
if you have any appeal to make, let it be to the last.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> I <i>have</i> an appeal to make, but, even though compelled to
differ with so sage an adviser, I shall make it to an ally more powerful
than either.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And what is that?</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Self interest.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You think so?</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> I'm sure of it.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Will you permit me to suggest that an important ceremony
is to take place in this room to-night, and the hour approaches.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Well, then, if I appear abrupt, attribute it to your delicate
reminder, and not to my own desire. You love Marguerite Laroque&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Mademoiselle, this is beyond&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> You love Marguerite Laroque. That love is hopeless.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 48]</span>
Everything is prepared for the ceremony you speak of, and if a shade
of doubt as to her destiny existed, it can live no longer now. I possess
a secret which, if given to the world, will compromise your honesty
as a man, your honor as a gentleman, and sink the proud name
you bear to a depth that even the despised governess could look down
upon with pity. Manuel Marquis de Champcey, give <i>me</i> the title <i>she</i>
can never bear, and I am silent. A wife none the less devoted because,
at first, unsought&mdash;a friend none the less sincere, though newly
found.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Mademoiselle, you are a singular instance of a well known
fact.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> And what may that be, sir?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> That the cleverest people sometimes do the silliest things.
Had you been a simple, uneducated rustic, you would have reflected
seriously before you lowered yourself in the opinion of the man you
professed to love. But, as you are&mdash;accomplished, shrewd, and resolute,
you have taken the worst road by which to gain the end you
coveted. Nay more; you have allowed impulse to snatch the reins
from principle, and those unbroken steeds, Passion and Ambition,
have taken the bit in their mouths, galloped off with common sense,
and I very much fear it will cost you some time and trouble to come
up with them. I need hardly add, Mademoiselle, that I decline continuing
this conversation.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> [<i>After a pause.</i>] Be it so. The sooner ended the sooner

<p class="ralign">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Alain</span> <i>and servants</i>.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Before you proceed to business, Monsieur Nouret, I will
make a few preliminary remarks, if you will allow me.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Nouret.</i> Certainly, Doctor. Pray speak.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> For the information of those friends of the family who are
yet unacquainted with the facts, I wish to state that, before the death
of M. Laroque, he wrote a letter to be given to me, his oldest friend,
when he was no more. I shall read a short extract. [<i>Reads.</i>] "For
these reasons it is my earnest desire, nay positive injunction, that my
grand-daughters' marriage shall take place within six months of my
death, with the same ceremonies and rejoicings as though I were still
living, and the reading of the will shall immediately succeed the
marriage." And now, Monsieur, before proceeding, it is necessary
for you to state that all is ready for the reading of the will immediately
on our return.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> N. I trust all <i>will</i> be ready, Doctor; but, at present, I can<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 49]</span>not
say it is so, for although I find the will and codicils of the deceased
to be in the most perfect order, and numbered in regular succession,
I have, thus far, been unable to discover the first of the series,
marked No. 1. All the rest are here&mdash;2, 3, 4, and 5&mdash;but 1 is
wanting. Now the legacies are, with the exception of a few to the
old servants, entirely to Mons. Laroque's blood relations.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> [<i>Weeps.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p><i>Mons. N.</i> Be comforted Madame, he was indeed a kind man. His
blood relations have all been thought of.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> But I'm <i>not</i> a blood relation. Oh!</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Is it not possible that the missing paper may contain&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> No doubt of it, no doubt of it. And that is burnt.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Burnt!</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> You saw Mons. Manuel, the steward, burn a paper. You
found the envelope, and gave it to me?</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> I did, but I never&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Silence! [<i>Gives envelope to</i> <span class="smcap">Mons. Nouret</span>.] Examine
that, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mons. N.</i> It is the hand-writing of the deceased, and the envelope
of the peculiar size and make of all the others.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>All look at</i> <span class="smcap">Manuel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Monsieur Manuel, what have you to say to this?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Speak, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> The lady is right, I <i>did</i> burn the paper.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Great Heavens!</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>All rise.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But she is mistaken as to the purport of the document.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Upon my soul this is a little too strong.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Oh, Monsieur Manuel, do not tell me you have so far
abused our confidence. Do not tell me that one whom I had begun to
love almost as a son, has fallen low enough to commit so vile an act.
I am an old woman, sir, and in the course of nature, you must outlive
me. My child is provided for. You shall share with me while
I live, and all I have shall be yours at last if you will but refute this,
if you will but give me the joy of knowing you are innocent.</p>

<p><i>Mons. N.</i> Come sir, this painful matter may be set at rest, perhaps,
if you will tell us the content of that paper.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Manuel, my son.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Oh! for my sake!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Marguerite</span> <i>and says</i>.] I will not speak.</p>

<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Desmarets</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> [<i>After a short pause.</i>] Then sir, much as it pains me,
you must, clearly understand that we can live no longer under the
same roof.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Going.</i>] I know it, madame.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> And [<i>He turns at the sound of her voice</i>,] have you <i>nothing</i>,
not <i>one</i> word to say in your defence?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Not one word.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Oh Marguerite, my joy on this occasion is lost in this
most unhappy discovery.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] And my misery doubled. Do not follow me, dear
mother, I will rejoin you directly.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> My dear madame, I beg to remind you that this is my wedding

the carriages will be ready immediately.</p>

<p class="ralign">[<i>Exeunt guests and</i> <span class="smcap">Madame Aubrey</span>.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">M'lle H.</span>] Mademoiselle, you do not appear as much
shocked as we are by this unfortunate discovery.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Simply, Doctor, because, knowing the gentleman, I am
not surprised.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> You are not?</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Not at all.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Umph! Bevannes, my dear fellow, I'm loth to delay an event
which, by a popular but pleasant fallacy, is supposed to be the happiest
in a man's life, but I must request, before we go to the chapel,
that you will give me a few moments of your attention.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Certainly Doctor; the evening's before us. Pray vary the entertainment
according to your own taste.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> My dear madame, I must also request <i>your</i> presence, and, as
what I am about to say is important, and guests are still arriving,
this apartment will soon become too public for our purpose, therefore,
with your permission, we'll retire to the library which, as the
works it contains are purely instructive, is about the last place our
fashionable friends are likely to visit.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> Had we not better wait until we return from&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> By no means. What I have to say must be said at once, and
so, madame, permit me.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Offers arm.</i></p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Doctor, that's a remarkably nice young man you recommended
for steward.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Never mind him. We'll talk about him to-morrow.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manuel</span>, <i>dressed for traveling</i>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> For her, for her, this bitter, bitter trial. Oh, let that thought
sustain me. Falsely I had imagined that the change from the sweet
dreamy days of my youth, to the stern realities of my manhood, had
created for me that tower of strength to the unfortunate&mdash;endurance.
But, no, no; too truly do I feel that, until this moment, I have not
known what utter misery is&mdash;one last, last look at scenes made sacred
by her presence; at objects hallowed by her touch, and then, and
then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Manuel!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Marguerite!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Hush! move not, nor speak till you have heard me. I am
here to ask forgiveness.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Forgiveness?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Now, now, I know your truth, too late, oh, Heavens! too
late late I know your pure, unselfish heart. You bore suspicion, insult,
scorn, but I believed you not. How nobly you risked life for
honor; yet I believed you not.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> At last then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> At last, conviction came; that letter you mislaid&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Relating to my sister&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Aye, and <i>not</i> to me. I know it now, Desmarets told me all.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And could you think&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I did, I did. Oh, do not scorn me, but grant my prayer, the
first, the <i>last</i> you'll ever hear from Marguerite. There is some mystery
hidden beneath your refusal to speak of the paper you destroyed&mdash;some
reason which refers to <i>me</i>. Do not deny it, for I know it.
You cannot deceive the watchful eyes of love&mdash;for <i>I love you</i>, Manuel.
We <i>must</i> part, and forever. My word is pledged already for
my marriage with Bevannes. But by the love which you professed
for me, for your dear sister's sake, for <i>mine</i>, [<i>she kneels</i>,] clear your
good name of this foul stain. Oh, Manuel! Manuel! do it in pity
for the rash, unhappy girl, who, with ruin staring at her from the
fatal rock, suspicion, spite of reason, spite of warning, wildly, madly
dashed herself upon the shore and made her heart a wreck.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">M'lle Helouin</span>.]</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Good. I could not have wished it otherwise. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mad.
Laroque</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Desmarets</span> <i>who appear with</i> <span class="smcap">Mad. Aubrey</span>, <i>guests
and</i> <span class="smcap">Mons. Nouret</span>.] Look, Madame! Look, sir! Observe the faithful,
loyal steward, who, not content with fraud and betrayal of his
trust, still lingers on the scene of his disgrace. Behold the proud
<i>gentleman</i>, who completes his list of honorable actions by ensnaring
the affections of that unthinking girl&mdash;the betrothed wife of another,
the daughter of his benefactress. [<span class="smcap">Madame Laroque</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Desmarets</span>
<i>raise</i> <span class="smcap">Marguerite</span>, <i>who is almost fainting</i>.] Well, you hear all this;
you witness it&mdash;you are men and stir not&mdash;your friend is betrayed&mdash;an
aged lady insulted in your presence, yet there stands the man,
erect and fearless. Will you bear this, I say, or will you cast him
forth like the dog he is?</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>The gentlemen make a movement toward</i> <span class="smcap">Manuel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Stop. Before Mons. Manuel departs, I have a piece of intelligence
to communicate, which it is important for <i>him</i>, as well as you,
to hear. You will the better comprehend it, if I request your patience
while I read a portion of this paper, left in my care by Mons.
Laroque, with discretionary power to destroy or reveal its contents as
my judgment should dictate. Under present circumstances I choose the
latter course. This is in the old man's own handwriting, and you
will admit, is an important episode in his history. The events described
occurred in the West Indies. [<i>Reads.</i>] "On the approach
of hostilities between the French and English, my father, Pierre
Laroque, who was steward to the then Marquis de Champcey, received
orders to sell immediately, the magnificent estates on the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 52]</span>
island, and then to join the Marquis (who commanded a small
French fleet) and to bring with him the money realized from the
sale. The estates were sold for a very large sum. With this money
my father and myself started to join the Marquis, but, on our way
were interrupted by an English frigate and taken prisoners. My
father died defending himself. I was promised my life, and permission
to escape with whatever money we had with us when taken,
if I would reveal the hiding place of the French fleet. How shall
I write the words? <i>I yielded.</i> A large English force attacked
them. The Marquis was killed, and I came to France a wealthy,
but dishonored man." Such is the confession left in my hands.
Such is the confession which makes the present Marquis de Champcey
master of this and all the property the old man left, and such is the
duplicate of the paper which that young man destroyed.</p>

Ah! no. One hope <i>is</i> left. Mons. de Bevannes, you are
well arrived. In good time to defend your honor, which is greviously
in peril here. That man, the steward, by a strange reverse of
fortune, has become master of this great estate.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> So I have already been informed.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Well, look there. Have you eyes?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Madame, you wound my vanity.</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Do you not see that the new master here is likely to become
lord where you alone should reign? Will you tamely submit
and give her up?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Madame, you just now reflected on my person, now you do
worse; you attack my heart. Do you think I am the man to step
between two devoted young creatures for my own selfish ends? No!
The moment I found the dear girl was penniless, I destroyed the contract,
and in the most generous manner, gave her back her word.</p>

<p><i>Mad. L.</i> I won't go near her. I do believe she'd bite me. Doctor,
will <i>you</i> have the goodness?</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mlle Helouin</span>.] Mademoiselle, you were very anxious
just now for somebody to turn out&mdash;I don't wish to be ungallant&mdash;but
what is going to take place here will coincide so little with your
arrangements, that the ladies think&mdash;that perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mlle H.</i> Enough, sir. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Manuel</span>.] If I am criminal, you shall
not call me hypocrite. I go, and as a parting gift, take from me such
wishes for your future, as bitter scorn and baffled hate may leave.</p>

<p><i>Des.</i> Now&mdash;at once? Of course; do you think all our pretty preparations
are to go for nothing?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Mademoiselle, I've got myself up utterly regardless of expense,
and if <i>somebody</i> ain't married, I shall withdraw my consent.</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> Oh, Mons. de Bevannes do not let that deter you, if you
meant what you said the evening Mons. Laroque died.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I!</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> Why, be it so.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Be it so? Be it what, Madame?</p>

<p><i>Mad. A.</i> I will dispense with further courtship.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> You may, for an indefinite period.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>They go up.</i></p>

<p><i>Des.</i> So, as soon as Manuel has changed his dress&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Nay, dear Manuel, you shall not change it. For the last

at it, dearest. It lacks the rich color and the gorgeous blush of one
you gave me once before. But that was lost and trampled under

of dear hopes and happiness to come.</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
